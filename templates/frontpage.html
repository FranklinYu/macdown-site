    <h2>What is MacDown?</h2>

    <p>MacDown is an open source Markdown editor for OS X, released under the MIT License. It is heavily influenced by <a href="https://twitter.com/chenluois">Chen Luo</a>’s <a href="http://mouapp.com">Mou</a>. This is how it looks:</p>

    <h2>Why Another Markdown Editor?</h2>

    <p>I like Mou. I write Markdown all the time, and since I use OS X on a daily basis, Mou is my go-to editor whenever I wish to generate something with markup. But I had always wanted something more.</p>

    <p>It came as a great shock when Chen Luo announced that he felt he could not actively continue the development, and wished to <a href="http://www.v2ex.com/t/112732">sell the ownership of Mou</a>. <a href="http://www.v2ex.com/t/113734">No suitable offers surfaced</a> (I honestly do not think there will be, either), and I decided that instead of waiting for others to do something about this, I should act myself.</p>

    <p>I don’t have nearly enough money to match Chen Luo’s purposed offer, but I do have my own pocket of tricks and some free time. So I started from scratch, spent some weekends hacking together my own solution. And this is the result.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Update:</strong> (20141002) Chen Luo has since <a href="https://twitter.com/chenluois/status/484488917165416449">resumed development for Mou</a>, and launched a <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mou-1-0-markdown-editor-on-os-x-for-you">funding campaign on Indiegogo</a> for Mou 1.0. Although heavily influenced by it, MacDown is not related to Mou in any way. Development for Mou does not affect MacDown, and vice versa. I do not claim MacDown as the “spiritual succesor” of Mou, and do not encourage such impression. MacDown is more like a Mou <em>replacement</em> if you must compare the two projects with each other.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>What’s in the Box?</h2>

    <p>MacDown is heavily influenced by Mou, and I try to mimic much of its behaviour as much as possible both in UI and the logic underneath, only making changes when I feel that improvement is necessary. Highlights include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Highly customisable Markdown rendering.</li>
      <li>Syntax highlighting in fenced code blocks.</li>
      <li>Sophisticated auto-completion.</li>
    </ul>
